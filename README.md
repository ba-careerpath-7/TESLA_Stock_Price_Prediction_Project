# 🚗 TESLA Stock Price Prediction Project



## ⭐ Project Overview

This project analyzes Tesla stock prices from 2016 to 2025 using both **machine learning** and **time series forecasting** methods. The goal is to explore patterns, trends, and seasonality in the stock prices and provide insights for decision-making.

* **Short-term predictions** are generated using **machine learning models** like Linear Regression, which capture daily price changes.
* **Long-term forecasts** are produced using **time series models** such as **Prophet, SARIMA/SARIMAX, and custom State-Space models**, which account for trends, seasonal cycles, and uncertainty.

# 📂 Objectives

1. Apply ML models to daily Tesla stock prices to examine short-term predictions.
2. Apply time series models to monthly stock prices to forecast trends and identify seasonal patterns.
3. Generate insights and potential business applications, such as optimal buy/sell periods.

## 🔑 Key Findings

* Tesla stock prices show an upward trend after the year 2020.
* **Seasonality patterns are visible: January tends to spike, spring months dip, and prices rise from summer through late winter.
* Linear Regression achieved the lowest RMSE among ML models for daily predictions.
* Prophet and State-Space models provided prediction intervals and trend forecasts for long-term monthly data.
